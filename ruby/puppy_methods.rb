			He trying to roll me up, I ain't picking up
			Headed to the club, I ain't thinking 'bout you
			Me and my ladies sip my D'USSÃ‰ cup
			I don't give a fuck, chucking my deuces up
			Suck on my balls, pause, I had enough
			I ain't thinking 'bout you
			I ain't thinking 'bout
			
			Middle fingers up, put them hands high
			Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye
			Tell him, boy, bye, middle fingers up
			I ain't thinking 'bout you

			Sorry, I ain't sorry
			Sorry, I ain't sorry
			No no, hell nah
			
			Now you want to say you're sorry
			Now you want to call me crying
			Now you gotta see me wilding
			Now I'm the one that's lying
			And I don't feel bad about it
			It's exactly what you get
			Stop interrupting my grinding
			I ain't thinking 'bout you
			
			Sorry, I ain't sorry

			Sorry, I ain't sorry
			I ain't sorry
			No no, hell nah
			
			Looking at my watch, he shoulda been home
			Today I regret the night I put that ring on
			He always got them fucking excuses
			I pray to the Lord you reveal what his truth is
			I left a note in the hallway
			By the time you read it, I'll be far away
			I'm far away
			But I ain't fucking with nobody
			Let's have a toast to the good life
			Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
			Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
			We gon' live a good life
			Big homie better grow up
			Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
			I see them boppers in the corner
			They sneaking out the back door
			He only want me when I'm not there
			He better call Becky with the good hair
			He better call Becky with the good hair
